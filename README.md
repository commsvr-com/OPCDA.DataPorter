# OPCDA.DataPorter

## Preface

CommServer is a package of software to manage data transfer. Built-in technologies and algorithms provide a smart data transmission that automatically adapts its parameters to the process needs and underlying communication network capabilities.

The OPCDA.DataPorter software was written by CAS Lodz Poland. I am the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source.

## DataPorter introduction 

`DataPorter` - ports data between most popular standards (OPC, XML, SQL)â€“ software installation. `DataPorter` is an independent package of the CommServer software family. It is designed to integrate industrial applications - as an engine to port data between most popular standards.

DataPorter is very flexible and can be used to:

- Transport or move data between OPC Servers
- Do some simple data processing (adding, subtracting, scaling, average calculation for selected tags),
- Publish data using Web Services,
- Buffer data in first in first out (FIFO) queue protecting important data,
- Read or write from SQL databases.

DataPorter is like a bridge between technologies - it allows to interconnect applications implementing different technologies (standards) in order to manage data flow.

Installation package contains:
